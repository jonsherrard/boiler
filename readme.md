# Boiler
## Node & Mongo Apparatus 

Boiler is a getting started repo for Express.js and the native Mongo Driver. I'm trying to comment as much code as possible: A - because there's not that much of it, and B it's easy to forget what things do. I hope a side effect of that is that it's a useful repo for Node beginners to use.

## Roadmap
 - Include instructions for install Node and Mongo.
 - Include Home | Login | Register | Loggedin views.
 - Write the mechanism for registering and logging in.
 - Including nodemailer, use Ghosts email supplier, as more people may have an account with them.
 - Include a branch that has twitter bootstrap styling.
 - Include a grunt file for the front end.
 - For the production config, default to user and password for mongo auth.
 - User passport for Auth, allows swapping between OAuth 2 providers and local User Email
 - Use node clustering on error, to bring down and restart processes.
